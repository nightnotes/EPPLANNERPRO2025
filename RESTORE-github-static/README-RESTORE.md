This repository is a static snapshot of the working site.
Netlify is configured (via netlify.toml) to **not** build and to publish the repo root directly.

How to use:
1) Push these files to your GitHub repo (replace contents).
2) In Netlify (Site settings â†’ Build & deploy), ensure Build command is blank (or respect netlify.toml) and Publish directory is ".".
3) Trigger a deploy (Clear cache and deploy).

You will be back to the exact working version ("ZO MOET DE SITE ZIJN").
