This repo matches Netlify UI settings that publish the "dist" directory.
- The working site snapshot is under ./dist
- The build step is a no-op and will pass.

If you prefer to publish from repo root instead, use the other ZIP (RESTORE-github-static.zip) and set Build command empty, Publish directory "."
